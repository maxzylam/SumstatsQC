# SumstatsQC-dev-1

Development version of GWAS Summary Statistics QC Pipeline

## Background

Common variant GWAS have been ubiquitous in identifying underlying biology in numerous traits. Research at both consortia and biobank level had been important in driving large-scale discovery GWAS. Summary statistics uploaded in public repository have become an invaluable resource for downstream GWAS analysis, included identifying genetic correlation, for polygenic risk score prediction, Mendelian Randomization, fine-mapping etc. However, to further use these summary statistics for the above-mentioned downstream analysis, some level of quality control is required due to differing GWAS pipelines used for QC and imputation previously.
